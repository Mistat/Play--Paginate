*Play--Paginate*

Adds two new tags:

#{paginate.list/}, which works as a drop-in replacement for #{list/} to show one page at a time
and
#{paginate.controls/} to display the pagination controls

Pagination controls are controlled by the view paginate/Controls.html and can be overridden in your project.
